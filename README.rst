Purpose
*******
The `Open edX Platform <https://openedx.org>`_ is a service-oriented platform for authoring and
delivering online learning at any scale.  The platform is written in
Python and JavaScript and makes extensive use of the Django
framework. At the highest level, the platform is composed of a
monolith, some independently deployable applications (IDAs), and
micro-frontends (MFEs) based on the ReactJS.

This repository hosts the monolith at the center of the Open edX
platform.  Functionally, the edx-platform repository provides two services:

* CMS (Content Management Service), which powers Open edX Studio, the platform's learning content authoring environment; and
* LMS (Learning Management Service), which delivers learning content.

Documentation
*************

Documentation can be found at https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform.

Getting Started
***************

Installing and running an Open edX instance is not simple.  We strongly
recommend that you use a service provider to run the software for you.  They
have free trials that make it easy to get started:
https://openedx.org/get-started/

If you will be modifying edx-platform code, `Tutor`_ is
the community-supported Docker-based Open edX distribution, both for production and
local development. The goal of Tutor is to make it easy to deploy, customise,
upgrade and scale your Open edX installation.

You can read more about getting up and running with a Tutor deployment
at the `Site Ops home on docs.openedx.org`_.
